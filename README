SMArt Rx Reminder
Josh Mandel, CHIP
-----------------

# Getting Started
A sample SMArt REST App that gets a medication list and displays when
each prescription fulfillment will run out.

You can run this app inside the reference container by hosting it
locally with webpy.

For example, to get started on ubuntu, you can
  apt-get install python-webpy
  apt-get install git-core
  git clone https://github.com/chb/smart_rx_reminder.git
  cd smart_rx_reminder
  python reminder.py 8000

Then log in to the reference container at:  
 http://sandbox.smartplatforms.org

Launch the "Developers Sandbox" app, which will point at your locally
hosted version of SMArt Rx Reminder.

# Files reminder.py: 
Implements a simple SMArt REST app, obtaining OAuth tokens from a
browser-supplied cookie, fetching a medication list for the in-context
patient, and doing some very simple processing.
